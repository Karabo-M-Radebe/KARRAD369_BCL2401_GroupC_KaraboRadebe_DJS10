## Project Brief: DJS10 - Asynchrony


# Project Overview
- "Dive into the asynchronous world of React by creating an application that fetches and displays blog posts from an API. You'll practice handling API calls with the Fetch API, managing application state, and gracefully handling errors."

# Project Brief
- My task was to build a React application that makes HTTP GET requests to the JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve a list of dummy blog posts. The application should render the titles and bodies of these posts on the screen. I also had to implement error handling to manage unsuccessful API calls.

# Elements included 
- Correct implementation of asynchronous data fetching.
- Effective state management and error handling.
- Code readability and structure.
- Handling of edge cases and potential errors.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
- I successfully coded a solution that had effective state management and error handling

### Challenges faced 
- I had no overt challenges faced, simply building asynchronous fetching 

### Areas of Improvement 
- When it comes to error handling and state management I feel comfortable enough to find a solution with the tools. Moving forward though, I would like to improve using asynchronous data fetching with more abstraction in mind 

## Overall learning experience
My overall learning experience for this project was simply a revision based exercise with a twist. I enjoyed implementing effective state management as it is still a new skill for me and it excites me when I get to use it.
